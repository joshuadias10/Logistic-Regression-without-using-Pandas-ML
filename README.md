# Logistic Regression Without using Pandas library

This project implements a logistic regression model using scikit-learn without relying on pandas for data manipulation.

## Description

This example demonstrates how to apply logistic regression to a dataset from scikit-learn's built-in collection. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained and evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

## Key Features

- Utilizes scikit-learn for logistic regression.
- Does not use pandas for data handling.
- Provides model evaluation metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Requirements

- scikit-learn
- numpy
